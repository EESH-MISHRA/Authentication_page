   --> Authentication Page Project <--
   
This project is based on the login and sign in page which accepts username and password and create an account 
the user can login by filling right credentials 
if the user forgot password they can see their password by just giving username.

--> scalability factor:

-> The project can be used in small workplaces where the employee authentication database is limited without scope 
   of password reset and user backup availability.

-> Here the employee can recover their account info provided by the company.
